For homework tonight, please add CRUD functionality for comments to this application.

Start by adding some seed data to the grumbles controller: https://github.com/ga-dc/grumblr_angular/blob/controllers-and-directives/js/controllers/grumbles.js#L4

Then display the comments on the page using `ng-repeat`

Allow the user to toggle a new and edit form for comments. When the user submits the form, add or remove the comment from `this.grumbles`
in the controller.

### Homework Solution

    $ git checkout -b controllers-and-directives-with-comments origin/controllers-and-directives-with-comments
